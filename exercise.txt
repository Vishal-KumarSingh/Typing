So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent?
According to McClintock,
a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of
Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide
placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type
specimen book.Its difficult to find examples o
f lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular
 as a dummy text in the 1960s,
although McClintock says he remembers coming across
 the lorem ipsum passage in a book of
old metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated
where he once saw the passage,
but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th century
supports the theory that the filler text has
been used for centuries."
In this article, we will see how to create a
countdown timer using Python.
The code will take input from the user regarding the
 length of the countdown in seconds.
After that, a countdown will begin on the screen of
the format ‘minutes: seconds’.
We will use the time module here.
